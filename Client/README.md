# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.






## **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**



It is a MERN stack project which is mainly about the various security policies and compliance of the products. This is an integrated framework for security requirements identification and assessment which can help organizations ensure that their products meet security and compliance requirements. Main process is to assess the product's security and compliance against the identified requirements. This can be done by conducting vulnerability assessments which is questionnaire driven. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of current state of product’s security and recommend the security requirements based on the assessment.

This helps the organizations to understand the security requirement of their products by selecting the appropriate standards like NIST, ISO or CIS. This approach is intended to help the organizations to proactively develop more secure and compliant products while reducing the time and effort required to achieve compliance later in the product life cycle. It offers a set of principles to evaluate and enhance the security status of the product, with the aim of enabling a zero trust approach. It enables the product team to ensure that the product’s security level is regularly updated and recommendations are made based on its current security levels.

## **MATURITY LEVEL**

This is mainly used to determine the maturity level of the product.
It is determined based on the product attributes given by the user.
There are three levels , if the maturity level of the product is 3 then it includes all the controls of three levels. 
The controls from levels 1 and 2 are included if the level is 2. 
This framework is mainly built using ASVS (APPLICATION SECURITY VERIFICATION STANDARD) policies which has three levels with 14 security categories all together has more than 150 controls.
